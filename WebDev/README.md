## What is Web Development ?  🧠

Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.

## What do Front-End Web Developers Do?
Front-end developers are the ones that create the part of a website that you see. They use HTML, CSS and usually JavaScript to create the front-end. They might also utilize a framework like React, Vue or Angular, depending on their personal skillset and the demands of the client.

## What do Back-End Web Developers Do?
Back-end developers are responsible for making sure that the data the website or web app needs is available for the front-end to present. This involves setting up servers, creating API's and making sure that the product can handle the amount of users it wants to serve. This gets more complex the more users access a site.
