## What is App Development 📱?
Application development is the process of creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks that a business requires. From calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports, applications help businesses automate processes and increase efficiency. Every app-building process follows the same steps: gathering requirements, designing prototypes, testing, implementation, and integration.

The primary responsibilities of an App Developer include creating, testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These developers typically work in teams, and think of ideas and concepts either for the general public, or for a specific customer need.

Mobile applications have become big business in recent years; in fact, statistics show that 21 percent of millennials open an app more than 50 times per day. While there is no denying the popularity of apps, the sheer number of these custom software applications can make it difficult to see results when creating your own apps. With more than 2.2 million apps available for download in the Apple App Store, and an additional 2.8 million in the Google Play Store, it makes sense that your app will have to stand out if you want a lot of people to download it. In the end, it all comes down to app development.
